    Kan "Hm mm mm mm hmmm."

    "Kanna hums along as we enter the school. I'm riding in her backpack again, this time with a very special box in here with me."

    Kan "That Maya's put up some real competition, but she's no match for my ultimate ability."

    Rin "Yeah, who knew you'd be good at baking! I'm honestly shocked."

    Kan "I’ve been practicing. Our class recipe contest is coming up, and when my turn comes, I’m going to make a cake so good that they’ll have to make me next year's student chef."

    Rin "I'll say. I haven't tasted chocolates like these in decades."

    Kan "...Huh? Aaaaa! Don't eat them! Those are for Kyousuke! What are you doing in there?"

    Rin "Delicious!"

    Kan "{i}pout{/i} When I give Kyousuke these extra special chocolates, he'll just have to fall for me."

    Rin "Oh, look, there he is!"

    Kan "{i}Eep{/i}!"

    "Kanna stops in her tracks."

    Rin "Just remember! Trust in the fancy chocolate!"

    "I hand her the box. She holds it with newfound confidence."

    Kan "Right. Fancy chocolate. Let's do this!"

    Rin "Ready? Go!"

    "She steps forward to Kyousuke."

    Kan "Kyou-"

    Maya "Oh Kyousuke, darling! I have an extra special surprise for you!"

    Kan "Grr!"

    Kyou "Oh, Maya, hey."

    Maya "I was thinking about how much you loved the rice balls I made for you yesterday, and I thought that I could do something to brighten your day!"

    Maya "So I'm going to make your lunch every day."

    Kan "{i}Nnnnnggg!{/i}"

    Rin "Relax, kiddo. Let your boy Ringo handle this."

    "I poke my head out of Kanna's backpack."

    Rin "Ahem..."

    # Art The usual CG?
    #Choice appears "What I'd really love right now is some extra special chocolates."

    "Perfect."

    Rin "Alright Kanna, here comes your cue."

    "Wait..."

    "...That smell."

    "But where-"

    "???"  "WAHAHAHAHA!"

    #ART Charlotte appears CG

    "???" "Prepare yourself, Kyousuke! For the rulers of this world have declared our sacred introduction!"

    #ART Show Kanna & Maya popins

    Maya "Who is this chick?!"

    "???" "By my authority as the master of the dark gateways between realms, I declare this man to be my eternal servant..."

    "???" "...In this life and the next, An eternal contract between you, Kyousuke, and the dark wizard Charlotte Von Vega!"

    Kyou "...Huh?"

    Char "Don't be alarmed. In this mortal form, I can manifest only one-tenth of my true power. When I present to you my gift, all of your questions will be answered."

    Char "Now eat! Taste the magical sensation of my strawberry cake of astral knowledge and be my companion for all eternity!"

    Kan "{i}Ehh?!{/i}"

    Rin "I don't know what this is, but it's no match for my power of suggestion."

    Kan "It's gone!"

    Maya "Kyousuke?"

    # CG Simulate "Eat Charlotte's delicious strawberry cake" being picked

    Kyou "I - I think I..."

    Kyou "REALLY WANT TO EAT THAT STRAWBERRY CAKE!!!"

    Maya "NoooOOOO!"

    Char "Well, Kyousuke, how does it feel? Do you suddenly find me...irresistable?"

    Char "Do you feel compelled to bow down at my feet and succumb to my every request?"

    Kyou "{i}Mmm{/i}, really good cake."

    Char "It's not working... why isn't it working!?"

    # CG Suddenly Maya comes back to her senses.

    Maya "Hey! What's the big idea? Don't eat that!"

    #SFX slap the cake out of his hands, plate falls to the ground, rolls around a little bit.

    Maya "I've got to get you away from this loon so you can enjoy my company properly! Come on, Kyousuke!"

    "She grabs his hand and pulls him away."

    Char "Wait! Come back. I command you to!"

    Char "{i}sigh{/i}"
    Char " Why didn't my spell work?"

    "Kanna backs away and we duck behind a corner."

    Kan "Ringooo! What do we do? That banshee is trying to steal him away from me! Why didn’t you stop Kyousuke from eating her dumb cake?"

    Rin "Something interfered with my suggestion magic. Normally I take a look at what he’s thinking and push him in your direction, but it’s like someone else did it first."

    Kan "{i}Gasp!{/i} The other spirit you were talking about? Is Charlotte a spirit?"

    Rin "Nope. She's not a spirit."

    Kan "Really?"

    Rin "Yup, she's completely human."

    Kan "But what about all that magic stuff? Those words she was saying?"

    Rin "Nope. Totally human. Not one lick of magic in her."

    Kan "So all those things..."

    Rin "There's no 'Master of the Dark Gateway' or whatever. Totally delusional! Aha!"

    #SFX Bell rings

    Kan "But how did she change your persuasion magic? I totally saw it."

    Rin "Yeah, about that...I'll handle it, don't worry. You head off to class. I've got some investigating to do."

    Kan "Alright, Ringo, I trust you."

    "She puts me down and goes off to class."

    Rin "{i}Sniff{/i} Alright. Now where are you..."

    Rin "I know you're there, somewhere. Show yourself!"

    # Fox appears

    "???" "Ah, I thought I had caught the scent of another spirit in the area. Although, I must confess,  I wasn't expecting a cute little teddy bear."

    Rin "Youko! So it was you who's been screwing up my magic! Can't you see I'm trying to grant a wish here?"

    Youk"Ha! Ringo - fierce servant of the god of fortune - did you lose a bet? I almost mistook you for a clearance sale toy."

    Youk "Your ridiculous form aside, as a fellow spirit, I'm sure you can understand that I'm merely acting in accordance to my master's will."

    Rin "Oh, you mean that dumb witch girl? How did the demon spirit Youko end up stuck with  a delusional high schooler?"

    Rin "Did {i}you{/i} lose a bet?"

    Youk "Wow, truly a clever retort. Genius, really...But yes, I lost a bet."

    Youk "That aside, I must ask that you don't interfere with my work. The lady Charlotte has requested a human companion, and it seems Kyousuke is the only boy who is acceptable."

    Rin "I've heard that somewhere before. Under normal circumstances, I'd be just fine letting you have him. I'm not so rude to interfere with the work of another spirit."

    Rin "But, this time, you can't have him!"

    Youk "Beg pardon?"

    Rin "I need him! I'm trying to make that boy go on a date with my wishmaker. You're messing that up, so, begone demon! Lest I smite thee, with the magic of  heaven's door,  or whatever."

    Youk "Oh, I'm absolutely trembling."
