    Rin "Wakey wakey!"

    Rin "Time to get up! Let's go, let's go, we've got a busy day!"

    Kan "Nnn…"

    Rin "Get up!"

    Kan "Nnnnn…"

    Kan "...I didn't mean to eat all those brownies."

    Rin "How can you get sick at a time like this? What about school? What about our plan?"

    Kan "My stomach hurts. Let me sleep."

    Rin "Who's fault is that?"

    "{i}sigh{/i}"
    "I don't think she’s gonna be much help today."

    "Maybe I can take this opportunity for a solo mission… With Kanna bedridden, I can do a little sleuthing."

    "Dig up some dirt on  Kyousuke - find something useful for granting Kanna's wish."

    "After raiding her fridge, of course."

    "Woah, gotta hide!"

    Boy "Did you see something, pres?"

    Pres "...No, it’s nothing."

    "That was close - that blonde girl almost saw me."

    "It's lunchtime now, so this place is just crawling with students."

    "But there's one in particular I'm looking for."

    "Just where is the lover-boy?"

    Maya "Kyousuke!"

    # Code Show Maya

    "Damn. It's that girl from yesterday."

    Maya "Oh Kyousuke darling, I have something for you!"

    Kyou "Hm?"

    Maya "My mom and I made rice balls this morning for lunch! We had some extras, so I thought I'd bring you some!"

    "That girl… Maya, was it?"

    "I don't have a problem with her type in most situations."

    "Under different circumstances, I might even find her a bit cute."

    Maya "Won't you try one, Kyousuke? There's a special surprise inside, I'm sure you'll like it!"

    "But, right now, this girl is putting my mission in jeopardy."

    # SFX of a sword being drawn

    "I might have to eliminate her."

    Maya "...Kyousuke?"

    #Music stop. Awkward pause.

    Kyou "...Hm?"

    Rin "...Are you just going to leave her hanging?!?!"

    Rin "IDIOT! TRY ONE ALREADY!"

    Kyou "Huh?!"

    Maya "Well?"

    Kyou "Is there a rice cracker in here?"

    Maya "Told ya there was a surprise inside, didn't I?"

    "Who puts rice crackers in rice balls?!"

    Maya "So, how does it taste?"

    Kyou "It tastes ricey."

    Maya "That's not the answer I was looking for."

    Kyou "Sorry."

    "I think you just lost points, Kyousuke"

    Maya "I hate to leave you, but I’m meeting up with a friend. Feel free to eat the rest and swing by my place to return the box, okay?"

    Kyou "Um... okay. Sure."

    "And with a flip of her hair, she's gone."

    Kyou "What just happened to me...?"

    Rin "I think you just triggered a flag there, buddy."

    "Wait - that’s it!"

    Kyou "A flag? Who said that? "

    Rin "Down here."

    Kyou "Hmm? Hwaa! What is that?"

    Rin "Jeez, no need to be rude. It’s me! Your... guardian angel! That’s right! Yeah! Your guardian angel!"

    Kyou "My angel? My angel is a bear?"

    Rin "Nevermind that! All you need to know is that the spirits have chosen {i}you{/i} to win the heart of a very lovely girl."

    Kyou "Me?"

    Rin "You. Now all you have to do is whatever I tell you, and I'll make sure you end up with the girl of your dreams. I’ll be the ultimate wingman."

    Kyou "Oh, really? Wow. Where do I sign?"

    Rin "No signature required. Just a deal between buds, ‘kay?"

    Kyou "This is awesome. I'm gonna get a girlfriend. Hell yeah!"

    Rin "Yep. Now, crouch down and let me get in your backpack; we guardian angels need to stay hidden."

    Kyou "You got it, dude!"

    "Now, how’s this gonna go?"

    "With my power of suggestion, I can whisper ideas in Kyousuke's ear."

    "I'll just feed Kyousuke the right ideas to push him towards Kanna, and away from other girls."

    "Kanna won't even have to try! I'm going to bring this idiot right to her, wrapped in a nice bow!"

    "This plan is perfect! It's so simple."

    "It's almost a shame that this is my last wish."

    Kyou "Hey, Angel?"

    Rin "Yes, buddy?"

    Kyou "Do you think returning her lunchbox counts as a date?"

    "{i}sigh{/i}"
    "This idiot is going to make this so easy."

    "This is also a good opportunity to get some insider info for Kanna."

    Rin "Hey."

    Kyou "..."

    Rin "Hey, wake up."

    Kyou "{i}Snore{/i}"

    Rin "I said wake up!"

    Kyou "Huh? Wha?"

    Rin "Class is over. You fell asleep."

    Kyou "Oh. Thanks for waking me up, Angel! You really are looking out for me."

    ###"Maya left him a message telling him she’d give him the notes if he dropped off the lunchbox, but I’ll just keep the note to myself."

    Rin "I got you covered, buddy."

    Rin "Ready to go home?"

    Kyou "Yeah! I just have to drop Maya’s lunchbox off. Oh, but wait, she has debate club today..."

    Kyou "I could wait until after her club, but I think she also wanted to get some archery practice in. Something about not being as good as the student council treasurer? Or was it the president?"

    Kyou "Or was it about the upcoming archery competition with the rival school?"

    "This kid likes to monologue."

    Rin "Not to worry, I slipped the lunchbox back into her bag while you were asleep. She almost caught me, but the mission was a success. Ready to go?"

    Kyou "Yep! Oh, but wait, should I ask Maya for the notes? Ahh, but she has her clubs..."

    "It’s gonna be a long night."
