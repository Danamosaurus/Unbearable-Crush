    scene Hallway
    Char "You're telling me Kanna has a spirit?"
    Char "Which is why the greatest embarrassment of all time has befallen me."
    Char "And why did you not mention this to me sooner?"
    Youk "I truthfully believed it wouldnâ€™t matter."
    Youk "I was under the impression getting Kyousuke to be your assistant would be a cakewalk,regardless of any spirit or human."
    Char "Alright."
    Char "I've decided."
    Char "I am going to..."
    Char "Wait for it."
    Youk "..."
    Char "Try the old fashioned way!"
    Char "While it may be uncouth and beneath someone who very literally has had her head in the clouds.The time for over the top shenanigans is over!"
    Youk "I'm afraid I don't follow, Do you mean to just walk up to Kyousuke and ask him?"
    Char "Exactly!"

    "In another part of the hallway."

    Maya "You're not going to tell me how you knew what Charlotte was going to do?"
    Maya "Or how you so accidently bought a blanket for Kyousuke, folded it exactly how it needed to be to trick Charlotte and used me as bait to set all this up?"
    Kan "Um... yes!"
    Maya "Yes? Yes, what? You're not going to tell me?"
    Kan "That's right!"
    Maya "And you expect me to just pretend all of that didn't happen, so we can both get Charlotte out of the way?"
    Kan "That's right!"
    Maya "Now I can go tell Kyousuke all of this so he can start questioning you too?"
    Kan "Not right!"
    Maya "Not right?"
    Kan "That's right!"
    Maya "Whatever. I know you're full of it Kanna."
    Kan "Hey, you said my name right!"
    Maya "Cut the perky act! You're a hypocrite. You just want Kyousuke to be happy? You manipulated Charlotte into looking like an idiot."
    Kan "You openly admitted to controlling Kyousuke!"
    Maya "I know you would do it too if you could."
    Kan "..."

    "Charlotte appears."

    Char "Is this where we are doing the cat fight, girls?"
    Kan "Good morning, Charlotte."
    Kan "I...I'm sorry about yesterday."
    Char "It's quite alright. The shinobu monks trained me to never have my guard down. Looks like I was more concerned with my illustrious magic craft than with my discipline training."
    Char "No matter! I'd like to speak bluntly today, mix things up a little, ya know? Save the verbose idle prattle for another time"
    Char "Even though my wording is always short and concise, I will be even more so today."
    Maya "Riiiigght."
    Char "Alright, ladies, let's get down to business."
    Char "Who gets Kyousuke?"

    "Both Kanna and Maya blush."

    Kan "Wha-whatever do you mean?"
    Maya "'Gets?' He's not a prize, he's a human being."
    Char "Pretty sure you don't feel that way, Maya. I think if he turned solid gold and shrunk down, you'd put him up on a shelf as a trophy."
    Char "You see him as an object, and not a beautiful instrument to be played."
    Char "An instrument that has the strongest, bulging biceps I've ever seen."
    Char "Amirite, ladies?"
    "Kanna and Maya" "Yeah, he does. {i}sigh{/i}"
    Maya "You shouldn't talk about him like that!"
    Char "I've been perfectly clear I want him to be my assistant, what's wrong with that? I pay a fair wage, and I'll waive his wizard training as long as he does everything I say."
    Char "And wizard training isn't exactly cheap now."
    Kan "I think you're both wrong! You should see Kyousuke as a person!"
    Kan "Love is something two people share together!"
    Maya "Kanna, you're willing to stomp on anything and anyone in order to get to Kyousuke."
    Char "Just like my mountain tribe stomping card trick!"
    Maya "Ya, sure, just like that."
    Kan"That's not true! I just..."
    Char "Just what, Kanna? Surely, there isn't some mystical secret that we both share that you don't want others finding out and that may have been altering the course of events lately?"
    Char "Or {i}iiiissss thhhhere{/i}?"

    "Maya glances over at Charlotte, then back to Kanna."

    Maya "What exactly does she mean by that?"
    Kan "I, um..."
    Kan "Think if something like that really did exist, and if one of us openly talked about it, then both of us would ruin our chances of succeeding in our goals."
    Kan "You should know that, as a fellow shinobu monk, any mystical secrets we have must not be shared."
    Kan "It could spell doom for the entire cosmos, and unravel time itself."
    Kan "Hahahaha!"

    "Charlotte squints at Kanna."

    Char "Fair enough I suppose, I somehow forgot you were in the monk fellowship. My apologies, Sister Kanna ."
    Char "But you need to work on your laugh though, next time start from the bottom of the lungs."
    Maya "Do you guys think I'm an idiot or something? You are clearly hiding something from me."
    Kan "Don't worry about it."
    Char "Don't worry about it."
    Maya "Wait, no, seriously, you can't just..."
    Char "Alright! So we all agree I will be receiving my Kyousuke check in the mail in four to six weeks, yes?"
    Maya "Hey! I've known Kyousuke the longest, I've had dibs on him for a while. Ever heard of dibs?"
    Kan "Isn't that a type of ice cream?"
    Char "Aw yes, dibs. The middle school playground tradition of being first in line, ergo first pick."
    Char "Well I was the third one here to vie for Kyousuke's attention. And three is bigger than one, so I win. I get Kyousuke."
    Kan "I don't think that's how it works. I think the person who wants Kyousuke the most should get a chance with him."
    Maya "No, wanting something badly and putting in the time for something are two completely different things."
    Maya "I've put in the grind for Kyousuke, day in and day out. Putting up with that moron for weeks now! You two just showed up outta the blue this week."
    Maya "How is that fair?"
    Kan "If he really wanted you Maya, you guys would be a couple by now."
    Maya "What?"
    Char "I think you may have trapped yourself in the friend realm, Maya. I used to live in that realm. While it is quaint at first, it slowly wears your soul down. "
    Char "It's better than the acquaintance sector though, let me tell ya."
    Maya "It's friendzone! God, why do you talk like that?"
    Char "I trained in dialectal speech patterns for this time and reality, I'm talking just like you guys do."
    Kan "Um, are you sure you studied the right time and reality?"
    Char "Absolutely! You guys still have a spectre problem around here, right?"

    Kyou "Well, I've been thinking about [Girls name with most number of points here] more and more lately."
    Rin "Really?"
    Kyou "Yea, but I really do like them all though. They are all pretty hot and fun to be around. Any one of them will work."
    Kyou "Are you absolutely sure I can't have them all?"
    Kyou "Maya and Charlotte can alternate Monday through Friday, and I can have Kanna on the weekends."
    Rin "Seriously, that's not how it works, bub. Here, let's do a thought experiment."
    Kyou "Alright."

    "(I know Kanna is starting to have doubts.)"
    "(I feel for her, I really do. A Lot of people start to have doubts about their wishes.)"

    "(I'll just have to do it now.)"
    "(You'll thank me later, Kanna.)"

    Rin "You're at the beach, Kyousuke."
    Kyou "Wicked."
    Rin "Just wait a second, there's more."
    Rin "You're chilling by yourself, laying on a towel, drinking a...what's your favorite drink?"
    Kyou "Cherry Kool aid."
    Rin "Seriously? Whatever. You're drinking a nice cold glass of cherry Kool aid. Sands between your toes, the salty sea air of the ocean gently flows between your nostrils."
    Rin "You can feel a little bit of sand in your hair, but it doesn't bother you since the taste of Kool aid is so darn good."
    Kyou "Oooh yeeeaaaa~"
    Rin "You look up and see three drop dead gorgeous girls your age, waving at you."
    Kyou "Tubular."
    Rin "There's still more."
    Rin " I pop out from your sandy backpack, which you packed tightly with snorkel gear, drinks, seaweed crackers, and sandcastle equipment."
    Kyou "Oh! What are you drinking?"
    Rin "I don't know, also a Kool aid I guess."
    Kyou "Flavor?"
    Rin "Ice blue raspberry lemonade."
    Kyou "Ah, that's a good one."
    Rin "I whisper into your ear,"
    Rin "'Do you want those girls?'"
    Kyou "Um, duh, yeah, I do!"
    Kyou "What kind of swimsuits are they wearing?"
    Rin "It's not that kind of thought experiment. Just shut up and drink your Kool aid."
    Rin "You can have any one of those girls, but you can only pick one. Do you have three girls in mind?"
    Kyou "I think so, yea."
    Rin "Alright, who do you pick?"
    Kyou "Hmmmm."

    Kyou "A game?"

    Kan "You know what I mean!"
    Char "So be it! Kyousuke!"
    Kyou "Um, yeah?"
    Char "Nevermind!"
    Kyou "Um, alright."
    Maya "What's this little game of yours Kanna, and why should I care?"
    Kan "We've all been arguing at eachothers throats for like a week now. Today, we end it."
    Kan "By the end of today, Kyousuke will put a letter in one of our lockers, picking a girl he would like to ask out."
    Kan "Or which girl CAN ask him out."
    Kan " Just a simple letter that says, 'I choose you,' or something."
    Maya "What?"
    Char " WAHAHAHA!"
    Char "This will be the easiest contest ever!"
    Kan "And, Charlotte, neither one of us will be using our shinbou monk training in order to influence Kyousuke in any way."
    Char "And why would I agree to that?"
    Kan "Because then I would reveal our secrets to Kyousuke and Maya here. And we both know that would spell disaster for the mortals of this realm."

    "The shadow below Charlotte begins to twitch slightly, Ringo is the only one to notice this."

    Char "{i}scoff{/i} Fine."
    Char "But remember, Sister Kanna, that includes you as well. No using your training on Kyousuke either."
    Kan "Deal."
    Maya "You guys are absolutely full of it."
    Char "What say you Maya? Do you agree?"
    Maya "..."
    Maya "Are you alright with this, Kyousuke?"
    Kyou "Well, I don't want to make anyone sad. So, does everyone agree to accept whoever I pick?"
    "Everyone nods in agreement."
    Kyou "Well, I guess I'm fine with it. It sounds kinda fun!"

    "The bell rings."

    Char "It's decided! We'll all await your decision, Kyousuke!"
    Char "And Kanna, you've been a worthy opponent. Certainly not the best, but worthy enough of my time."
    Kan "Thanks, I think?"
    Maya "Kyousuke...You...better pick the right person, got it?"
    Kyou "Sure, Maya."
    Kan "Alright, it's all settled."

    #Switch to Ringo and Youko in Kyousuke's backpack.

    Rin "You heard her, we're gonna follow the rules this time."
    Youk "'Que sera, sera.' I guess the simpleton needs to choose for himself at some point."
    Youk "Best of luck to you, Mr. Fortune."
    Rin "Same to you, I guess."

    Rin "I sure hope you know what you're doing, kid."
