    #We open to the familiar hallway, Ringo is alone, thinking about his next actions. He plans to investigate Kyousuke, and confront Youko when Charlotte inevitably shows up. Kanna is hanging back, eating lunch with her casual group of friends.

    Rin '"Business is the real force of this world, not luck, love, or anything in between."'
    Rin "{i}Gah{/i}, I hate him and his stupid company. The idiot girl couldn't even summon the right spirit to help her. Amatuer!"

    #Ringo spots Maya and Kyousuke talking. He floats over, and hides in Kyousuke's backpack.

    Maya "Kyousuke, how's little Rocko doing?"
    Kyou " Oh, my dog? He's great. I finally got him to blink with both eyes at the same time!"
    Maya "That's amazing, Kyousuke! How did you get him to do that?"
    Kyou "Well, once I figured it out myself, it wasn't too hard to show him how to do it."
    Maya "I'd love to see him again. Maybe we should take him for a walk together."
    Kyou "Say, I was going to take him out today... If you're free after school, we could go together."
    Maya "I have  jazz band practice after school... But I can skip it this time!"
    Maya "I highly doubt that the first chair bass string is as important as they say, anyway."
    Kyou "I thought you were in the volleyball club? Or was it baseball?"
    Maya "Don't you remember, Kyousuke? I'm in every club this school has to offer."
    Kyou "Every single one?"
    Maya "Every single one."
    Kyou "How do you make time for all that?"
    Maya "It's very easy actually. I have this system wher-"

    Rin "Showtime."

    #ART Enter Charlotte

    "There's something strange about Charlotte's shadowâ€¦"
    "It looked as if it was rippling."

    Maya "Uh, excuse me, we were in the middle of something here."
    Char "You're excused! Kyousuke, it is time for us to converse."
    Kyou "Converse?"

    "Kyousuke looks down at his shoes to see if he is wearing Converse."
    "He is not."

    Char "No, like with words, actions, emotions, dialogue and such. Although I'm flattered you noticed what I am wearing, thank you."
    Maya "Listen, wackjob, talk to Kyousuke on your own time. Neither of us appreciate you rolling up here and talking crazy."
    Char "Crazy? Are you referring to my intellect? My soul? {i}Gasp!{/i} Or maybe, my madness?"
    Char "If so, you are correct, for I really am the mad wizard of this school's halls."
    Char "The progenitor God of reality! The CEO of space and time itself! She, who bends gravity like a straw!"
    Char "Charlotte Von Vega! WAHAHAHAHA!"

    # SFX Comical wind breeze.
    # ART Ringo popin trying to hold his laugh, Kyousuke popin smiling, Maya fuming popin.
    #An awkward silence raises between them. Ringo is doing everything he can to hold back laughter. Kyousuke is smiling absentmindedly, while Maya is fuming.

    Maya "Really now?"
    Char "Really. I suggest you get in on my good side if you want to remain in your squishy, mortal form."
    Maya "How old are you?"
    Char "Older than the ancient reptilians that once roamed the earth."
    Maya "It's not everyday you get to see someone with a neanderthal brain. Isn't that right, Kyousuke?"
    Maya "You certainly have the forehead of one. Why don't you crawl back into the cave you knuckle-dragged yourself out of, and leave us civilized folk alone."
    Maya "You can chant to all the chalk drawings while you're in there. It'll make you feel better."

    "I look down again at the shadow to see Youko rising out of it."

    Char "I see."
    Maya  "Run along now, so Kyousuke and I can get back to cha-"
    Char "Who told you my secrets? How could you possibly know of my Badger Mountain Tribe ancestry? And my ability to speak with the people who live inside the walls?"
    Char "Granted we live much more dignified than how you describe, our cave walls are made of marble."
    Char "Still, your accusations are far too accurate to be mere japes! Who leaked my untold secrets to you?"
    Maya "...{w=1.0}Can you just leave, please?"
    Char "I know! We'll let the whims of fate decide what happens next. And by fate, I mean Kyousuke."
    Kyou "Who, me?"
    Char "Would you rather talk with someone who has seen the whole of the cosmos?"
    Char "Or someone doomed to wander the halls of mere mortal existence?"
    Kyou "Cosmo or wander? Cosmo and wander?"
    Maya "Would you rather discourse with {i}me{/i} or {i}her{/i}, Kyousuke?"
    Kyou "Um..."

    #ART #Once again the VN GUI pop ups in front of Kyousuke. Ringo pops his head out of Kyousuke's backpack to prepare what to do. Youko pops up right next to him, looking at the same choices. The girls continue to bicker.

    Youk "Not the brightest chap, is he? Poor kid."
    Rin "{i}Gah!{/i} Get your own backpack, this one's mine."
    Youk "Mr. Fortune, I suggest you rethink your actions."
    Rin "I'm just doing the same thing you're doing, buddy."
    Youk "Can you even do magic with those little fuzzy paws of yours?"
    Rin "Hey, this form wasn't my choice! You think I'd want to be a teddy bear?"
    Youk "Maybe it's your heart's true form, all cute and cuddly at its core."
    Rin "Whatever. You want to make the first move here, corporate hotshot?"
    Youk "With pleasure."

    # The VN GUI choices are as follows.
    Youk "Let's see what we have here."
    '"Keep talking to Maya."'
    '"Talk to Charlotte."'
    Youk "You see, the simpleton already wants to address my client. I can simply do this."

    #ANIM # The Charlotte choice glows purple, and begins to have sparkle effects around it. Kyousuke is entranced, and wants to choose it.

    Kyou "{i}Ooh!{/i}"
    Rin "Rookie mistake. It'll be a cakewalk to change his mind."
    Youk "Do prove me wrong. If you can, that is."
    # VOICE and AUDIO Some reverb should be applied to the voice file to make look like it's a thought and not a dialogue.
    Rin "(Ok what can we do here?)"
    Rin "(Kanna isn't here right now, so I guess I just  make both these girls look bad.)"
    Rin "(Or...)"
    Rin "(Make one look better than the other.)"
    Rin "(I hope this all works out in the end.)"
    Rin "(It's tricky without Kanna.)"

        Rin "If I'm not gonna win, you aren't either."

        Kyou "Hey Charlotte, I know you want to tell me all about your cool gravity straws, but I was talking with Maya first."
        Maya "Thank you, Kyousuke."
        Char "...Why are you siding with her?"
        Kyou "We've been friends for a while, and she was talking first."
        Char "Don't you feel a strong pull to talk with me instead?"
        Kyou  "Um, no. And you're acting kinda weird now."
        Char "I... I will remain here and spectate."
        Maya "Spectate?"
        Char "Yes, I... when Kyousuke talks, he gives off the energy my mage clan requires to weave their magic."

        #Choice "Ask them to stop fighting."

        Youk "Really? Is that your plan? Have them be friends?"
        Rin "Either that, or they fight harder and Kyousuke hates them both for it."
        Youk "I'm afraid you're misplacing your faith in a bunch of bickering school girls."

        Kyou "Hey guys, can you please stop yelling at each other? We're all friends here, right?"
        Maya "Kyousuke, I wouldn't say she and I are friends."
        Char "Yes! We are enemies, destined to fight to death in unarmed combat!"
        Maya "I can take you."
        Char "Oho, is that so? Do you know how long I have trained with the shinobu monks?"
        Char "Over three centuries! There's no way you can hope to best me."
        Maya "Seriously, I will put you in the dirt."
        Kyou "Maya, I don't like you talking this way."
        Kyou "You were kinda being mean like this when that Kanna girl was here."

        Maya "Kyousuke, you see how unreasonable she's being, right?"

        # ART CG? Or perhaps some kind of purple filter over the game screen?
        "Kyousuke looks over at Charlotte, but before he can comment, a slight purple and sparkling fog sets in, surrounding his face."

        Rin "Hey! You can't do that, that's cheating."
        Youk "How so? This spell of mine will only make him be a little more honest about his feelings!"

        Kyou "She's just having fun, Maya. If you can't see that, maybe you should be the one going  away."
        Char "Looks like he doesn't want you here, Maya."

    Kyou "Are you sure, Maya?"
    Maya "Yeah, see ya later Kyousuke."
    Char "Looks like I'm victorious!"
    Char "She must have realized how foolish it would be to tangle with a mage of the metaphysical universe!"
    Char "Kyousuke, I have something to ask of you!"
    Kyou "Um, sure, Charlotte. But I think we should probably start heading back to class too."
    Char "Precisely! You're already one step ahead of me."
    Char "As I expected of my future assistant. "
    Kyou "Assistant?"
    Char "Kyousuke! Please help me carry my books to class."

    #Two Choices pop up in front of Kyousuke as usual.

    Rin "What'd she wish for anyway?"
    Youk "For an assistant."
    Rin "So why on earth did you choose him?! He's useless!"
    Youk "She chose him, actually. She said his simple mindedness would block out any beings of greater intellect than herself."
    Rin "What?"
    Youk "She wants him, so I'm getting him for her."
    Rin "Oh, come on, you can choose any other dumb kid."
    Rin "Why don't you do the 'professional courtesy' of giving this one to me."
    Youk "I have an unbesmirched reputation to uphold, Mr. Fortune."

    "#Head to the bathroom."
    "#Ask the weird girl to go away."

    Rin "Pretty sure he doesn't want anything to do with her, buddy."
    Youk "Hm... Why don't you go first? As a courtesy for last time."
    Rin "Do I even need to do anything? I like both of those options."
    Youk "Humour me."

    Rin "(Well, I could just highlight one of the options.)"
    Rin "(Or maybe I can try to inject Kanna into this.)"
    Rin "(He did mention her earlier, maybe he's thinking about her?)"

    # ART Replace "Head to the bathroom" options with a golden "Try and find Kanna."
    #"Highlight: Head to the bathroom."
    #"Try and find Kanna."

    Youk "Really now? Is that your plan?"
    Youk "Well, no matter, it's of no consequence."

    # Art Replace the golden "Try and find Kanna." option with a purple "Carry Charlotte's books for her." Also, poof (remove) the other option.

    #Whatever choice the player picks, instantly gets replaced by a purple, shining option. The original choices are also gone, and the only option is Youko's magic.

    Rin "HEY! You can't do that, that's not even remotely fair!"

    Youk "I can, and I just did."
    Youk "I may only overwrite his thought process once a day, but that should be enough for now."
