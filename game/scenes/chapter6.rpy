scene Hallway

Kan "Hello. Maya, was it?"
Maya "Oh, Can-oh, what do you want?"
Kan "Listen, I know you don't really like me, but I think we can help each other."
Kan "We seem to have a... mutual problem."
Maya "Oh? And what exactly would that be?"
Kan "I'll give you a hint."
Kan "She laughs like a hyena and talks like an elementary schooler who's played a little too much D&D."
Maya "I think I have a pretty good idea about who you're talking about."
Maya "Now why exactly should we work together?"
Kan "We both can agree that we just want Kyousuke to be happy, right?"
Maya "I mean, as long as he is with me,  his happiness is assured."
Kan "Right, I'm pretty sure Kyousuke will be a lot happier with either one of us than with Charlotte."
Maya "You mean happier with me."
Kan "Whatever. Truce?"
Maya "Hm. I suppose I see your point. Truce."
Maya "You don't have any hope of winning over Kyousuke, you know."
Kan "Kyousuke is the coolest, handsomest, and most good-natured person I've met."
Kan "He'll know what to do and who to pick when the time comes."
Kan "And I've no doubt that person will be me."
Maya "Wooowww, so confident! Where's this coming from?"
Kan "It's gonna happen Maya; I know Kyousuke will do the right thing, no matter what. I believe in him"
Maya "That's nice and all, but you're just in denial. He'll never choose you."
Maya "He's not exactly the brightest.  He needs a little... persuasion in order to understand who he really likes."
Kan "What do you mean?"
Maya "He's dumber than a sack of potatoes, Can-oh. Even you must have noticed it by now."
Kan "No! Kyousuke is the smartest person in this school, hands down."
Maya "Oh, please. Have you seen his grades? I tutor him in math, not the other way around."
Maya "Although I make sure he thinks he's teaching me."
Maya "Giving people choices they feel they thought themselves is the easiest way to groom them to do what you want."
Kan "That's..."

#VOICE Whispering (Next two lines.)
Kan "Am I manipulating Kyousuke with Ringo?"
Kan "I just want him to be happy..."

Maya "What was that?"
Kan "...Look, you gonna help me take Charlotte down a peg or not?"
Maya "Might as well. Let's hear the plan."

#*Continuing with the guardian angel idea from Day 2*#
#Cut to another part of the hallway, Kyousuke is walking down the hall, Ringo is in his backpack.

Kyou "So… you can only pop up every few days?"
Rin "That's right, kiddo. I had to run a few... heavenly errands."
Kyou "You're still helping me get a girlfriend, right?"
Kyou "It's been tricky these last few days. More and more girls keep showing up. I can't keep track of them all"
Rin "Don't worry, Casanova, I'll make sure you end up with your special someone."
Kyou "Can I have all of them?"
Rin "Erm, no, bud. That's not really how this works."
Rin "I promise you I'll help you get true love, the next girl that comes around that corner may just be the one you spend the rest of your life with."
Kyou "Really?"
Char "WAHAHAHA!"
Rin "Not that one, maybe the girl after that."

#Ringo slides back into Kyousuke's backpack.

Char "Good morning, Kyousuke! After carrying my books yesterday, I'm here to officially give you your wizard training license!"
Char "A magical learner's permit, if you will."

#Charlotte pulls out a rock, seemingly from nowhere, and hands it to Kyousuke.

Kyou "Good morning Charlotte! Thanks for... are there googly eyes on that rock?"
Char "Yes! How else is it supposed to see?"
Kyou "What's written on it? Is that sharpie?"
Kyou "1e+22. What's that mean?"
Char "That's how many picoseconds you charged my mana yesterday."
Char "I need a power source capable of pumping out one gallon of mana every trillionth of a second. And you, Kyousuke, performed your duty magnificently."
Char "No mere mortal could generate that much output that fast!"
Kyou "Um, thanks, Charlotte. I'm doing the best I can."
Char "If you can beat yesterday's score, I'll place the third eye of Micolash upon the rock!"
Kyou "Cool! Does that mean you'll glue more googly eyes to it?"
Char "Naturally! The eyes mean we can gain insight!"
Char "Grant us eyes, o' powerful Micolash. Grant us vision to see past the delusions of our mere existence, so we may gaze into the metaphysical realm of the true cosmos. Bless us with your omnipotent-!"
Maya "Ok, you are acting exceptionally weird today."
Kyou "Good morning, Maya!"
Maya "Morning, Kyousuke! Are you getting your fortune told? Should I come back later?"
Kyou "Oh, no, Charlotte was showing me her arts and crafts project."
Char "Kyousuke! You dare compare my studies of the world beyond man to that of a simple humanistic expression?"
Maya"I think he does dare. Maybe if you could do something cool, like fortune telling, or maybe, mind reading, he would take you seriously."
Maya "Kyousuke's intellect is unrivaled, Charlotte. Just the other day, he was telling me about having boy cheerleaders to liven the girls as they play volleyball."
Maya "Which the school is currently talking about implementing, as they also thought it was  brilliant."
Kyou "I don't remember doing that."
Maya "You told me all about it a few days ago, remember? I did all the specifics and wrote your plans down and submitted them to the school."
Maya "It's all just busy paperwork, Kyousuke, trust me; but you get all the credit, don't worry!"
Kyou "Wow! Thanks Maya. I appreciate you helping me flesh out my ideas."
Kyou "It was a tricky problem to solve, but I'm sure the girls will love the support."

"Charlotte is clearly flustered about the lack of attention."
"I look down and see the shadow beneath her feet flickering again."

Char "Wait just a minute. I'll have you know I can perform such childish tricks as fortune telling AND mind reading."
Char "Pick your poison, Kyousuke. Which would you like to see?"
Maya "Hold on, how are we supposed to test this so-called magic of yours?"
Char "You really don't know? {i}Phhhbbt{/i}, of course you don't. Tell her Kyousuke."
Kyou "Umm, I'm actually not sure how to test that."
Char "Correct!"
Maya "Oh my god... Ok, if Kyousuke wants you to do fortune telling, you'll have to predict what will happen when the school bell rings."
Maya "If Kyousuke picks mind reading, both you and him will say what you're thinking in unison."
Char "Child's play! Something so easy is but a game for the child of the creator. The associate natural law breaker. Th…"
Maya "Can we just skip to the 'wahaha' part please?"
Char "WAHAHAHA!"
Maya "Thank you."
Char "Alright, Kyousuke, decide which magic you would like me to perform?"

# ART The usual VN choice GUI
"Two more choices appear in front of Kyousuke."
"Fortune-telling"
"Mind-reading"
"Youko appears in Kyousuke's backpack, right next to Ringo."

Rin "'About time you showed up."
Youk "Little Kanna is slipping out of the boy's mind, Mr. Fortune."
Youk "Are you even representing her? Maybe you should give her my card after this is over, I can find someone she'll like just as much as Kyousuke."
Rin "Not a chance, fancy pants. Kanna will win his heart, just you wait! I'm feeling generous. You make the first move today."
Youk "What move is there to make? Let's see what he picks, then go from there."
Rin "We both know that hyena is no fortune teller. You're gonna want to read his mind."
Youk "On the contrary. I can pull off whichever decision Kyousuke makes, mind reading is just more convenient"
Rin "Then make your move already."
Youk "Very well."

# ART
#Mind-reading begins to glow the familiar purple sparkle glow.
#Put Charlotte's effects on Mind-reading

Rin "(Alright, I know either way we go, we got this one in the bag.)"
Rin "(I can tell Kanna did her job, otherwise Maya wouldn't have brought up fortune telling or mind reading.)"
Rin "(Anyway, we need to tread carefully with these two clowns here.)"
Rin "(I could also highlight 'mind reading' and, if all goes to plan, shame Charlotte.)"
Rin "(I need Kanna here for 'fortune telling,' so maybe I can inject something to stall for time?)"

# CODE
#Menu: Choices for Kyousuke.
#"Highlight Mind reading"
#"Do a different magic trick."

#Choice 1.A "Mind reading."

Kyou "Try reading my mind!"
Char "Easy! You're thinking abou…"

"The shadow beneath Charlotte begins to warp a little, seemingly tugging at her."

Char "Er, how should we judge this? Maybe someone should give a topic?"
Maya "Ok, Kyousuke thinks of a color and says it outloud."
Char "Easy! Alright on the count of two."
Maya "On the count of three, can you be normal for, like, a minute?"
Char "I've avidly studied normality. Hence why I blend in so well at this school."
Char "How else would a priestess of my magnitude be allowed into such a common, mortal realm?"
Maya "Everything you spew is hot garbage. Let's just go."

Rin "You gonna cheat again?"
Youk "Override his brain, you mean? No need, we both know he's going to say red."
Youk "Nonetheless, I must commend you for trying to trick me into using my powers for matters so trivial."

"Youko vanishes from sight, returning to Charlotte's shadow to inform her of what Kyousuke will say."
"I can't help but grin."

Rin "The absolute idiot. I can just communicate with Kanna from here."

Maya "Three."
Maya "Two."
Maya "One."
"Charlotte &  Kyousuke" "Red."

Kyou "Woah!"
Char "See? There is nothing my powers cannot do!"
Maya "Red is the second most common favorite color."
Char "And? Do you not see his amazement at my abilities?"
Maya "And I'm saying it's a lucky guess. Let's try something a little trickier."
Maya "Favorite animal."

"Kanna turns the corner of the hall, sprinting at full speed."

Maya "Three."
Maya "Two."
Maya "One."

#SFX Kanna crashing into Charlotte.
#ART maybe a CG? If we have time and you guys want to.
Kan "GIRAAH!"
Char "ALLIRRGH!"
Kyou "Giraffe!"

"Kanna slams directly into Charlotte, knocking her clean off her feet to the floor."
"Kanna lays on top of her, reeling."

Kyou "Good morning, Kanna! Where are you off to in such a hurry?"
Char "Release your weight from my chest! The flow of mana cannot reach my lungs!"
Kan "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, are you alright?"
Char "Yes, I'm fine. Please, do be more careful, you almost awakened my alter ego. She’s even scarier than I."
Maya "Sorry, Charlotte. Looks like you guessed wrong."
Char " {i}Excusez moi?{/i}"
Maya "Honestly, Kanna sounded like she was going to say giraffe. You sounded like you were going to say alligator."
Char "That is absurd! This young woman hit me with the strength of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake."
Char "And I'll have you know, I've created earthquakes that break the magnitude scale."
Kyou "Sorry, Charlotte, I think Maya's right. Good job, Kanna! I didn't know you knew magic."

# CODE
#Choice 1.A    -1 Charlotte
#0 Maya
#+1 Kanna

#Choice 1.B "Do a different magic trick."

Kyou "Maybe instead of some mental stuff, you can do a classic card trick!"

#Show Rin and Youk

Youk "Did he… just pick yours?"
Rin "The kid just wants to see some card tricks or a rabbit out of a hat or something."
Youk "No matter, I can make this work."

Char "Um, I… er, Yes! Of course! What sort of magic trick were you thinking?"
Kyou "Can you pull a rabbit out of a hat? Wait, none of us are wearing hats. Um, can you do a card trick?"
Char "I am afraid I am not currently equipped with such a thing. You’ll just have to choose something else."
Maya "I carry cards in my backpack all the time. Poker club insists we all have our own deck."
Maya "Here."
Char "Pick a card there, tender Kyousuke. Memorize it. Commit your mental capacity to fully enter the card before you to memory."
Kyou "Got it.  Then I put it back in the deck, right?"
Char "Yes! Now, observe."

"Charlotte places the deck of cards on the floor. She stomps down hard, keeping her foot on the top of the cards."

Maya "Hey, don't do that!"
Char "It is fully necessary for this to happen in order for the trick to work. You'd be surprised how often people wish me to step on cards."
Maya "I don't want to think about that. And I also don't want you to ruin my RED cards."

"Awkward silence."

Kyou "Why did you just yell that Maya? I think my card was black anyway"
Rin "(Come on Kanna, hurry up.)"

Char "Hush, both of you! I'm spoon feeding myself the knowledge of this particular pack of cards."
Char "It's telling a story. How it was created in a factory, played hundreds of hands of poker by the delicate and single eyebrowed Maya."
Maya "Excuse me? I clearly have both my ey-"
Char " The cards are now telling me about the time, not long ago, when Kyousuke held one in his muscular fingers."
Char "Kyousuke! Your card is the red eight of…"

#SFX Kanna crashing into Charlotte.
#ART maybe a CG? If we have time and you guys want to.
Kan "GIRAAH!"
Char "ARRGH"

"Kanna slams directly into Charlotte, knocking her clean off her feet to the floor."
"Kanna lays on top of her, reeling from ramming headfirst into Charlotte."
"Cards blast up into the air, causing a mini explosion of playing cards to erupt around them."
# ART Maybe a CG of this, if possible?
"I  leap out of Kyousuke's backpack, snagging a card out of midair, and hand it to Kyousuke."

Kyou "Good morning, Kanna! Where are you off to in such a hurry?"
Char "Release your weight from my chest! The flow of mana cannot reach my lungs!"
Kan "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, are you alright?"
Char "Yes, I'm fine. Please be more careful, you almost activated the emergency self destruct."
Maya "My cards! Oh, come on!"
Kyou "Sorry Charlotte, your guess is wrong."
Char "{i}Excusez moi?{/i}"
Kyou "I have the black three of clubs, see?"

"Kyousuke shows her the card."

Char "What? The card I had - before this ten ton rerun of a girl body checked me - was definitely the correct card."
Kyou "But look, see?"
Char "Did you not grab that card when they exploded everywhere?"
Maya "You calling Kyousuke a liar?"
Char "No, but…"
Maya "But nothing. Good job Kyousuke, looks like you're the real magician here!"

# CODE
#Choice 1.B
#    Charlotte -1 points
#Maya +1 points
#Kanna 0 points

Char "Alright, that's it. Everyone, gather around, for I, Charlotte Von Vega, will allow one and all to view a spectacle of magic no one can comprehend!"

"A small crowd of other students begin to gather."

#Cut back to Ringo and Youko in Kyousuke's bag".

Rin "Oh boy, here we go."
Youk "You put Kanna up to that, didn't you? There was some sort of cue for her to barge in and tackle my Charlotte to the ground..."
Youk "Was it the color? Was the codeword 'red'?"
Rin "Yes, it was; kinda lucky it turned out this way, huh?"
Youk "Yes... Very fortunate..."
Youk "But, rest assured, this next trick will set things straight."

#Back to the group.

Maya "Are you finally going to do some fortune telling?"
Char "Yes, as a matter of fact, I am."
Kan " I... I feel bad for running into you Charlotte."
Char "Why exactly were you sprinting through the halls, anyway?"
Kan "I... was really excited to see Kyousuke. I just wanted to talk to you guys, that's all."
Char "That's the most suspicious answer you could have given."
Kan "H-hey, can I make it something easy for you? To prove how great you are?"
Char "Why, sweet Kanna, of course."
Kan "Tell us what kind of food I packed into my lunch box."
Kyou "Isn't that kinda like mind reading? We did that already, didn't we?"
Kan "Not if she doesn’t read my mind! It’s more like clairvoyance."
Maya "That's kind of boring. What if you already told her?"
Char "Wha?"
Kan "What do you mean, Maya?"
Maya "You could have easily told her what's in the lunchbox, shown her even! We need some sort of middleman to figure out what's in the lunchbox."
Maya "Like, someone to say what Charlotte's thinking maybe."
Char "That's it! Astral projection!"

"Murmurs among the small crowd that gathered."

Char "I, of course, already know what's in the lunchbox. But Kyousuke does not!"
Char "Using the powers of astral projection, I will communicate to Kyousuke what's in the box. And he will reveal the contents inside!"
Char "Kyousuke, can you confirm you have yet to see Kanna today, before she WWE tackled me?"
Kyou "Yes, I didn't see her before that."
Maya "I also attest that I didn't see Kanna before that, nor see Kyousuke talk to her."
Char "Alright, I will now begin the thought transfer."
Char "I will remain standing right here, so you can all see. I am now interacting with him purely through metaphysical cognitions."

"Charlotte places her fingers upon her forehead, and begins humming."

# CODE Show previous CG where Ringo and Youko talk on Kyousuke's backpack
#Cut back to Ringo and Youko.

Youk "I must congratulate you on your first attempt. Made me look like a fool. But it won't happen again."
Youk "Care to go first?"
Rin "Does it matter? You're just gonna overwrite him, aren't you?"
Youk "Oh, most surely."
Rin "Just get it over with already."

"Youko places one single purple choice in front of Kyousuke. "

Youk "A banana, yogurt, rice balls, and sushi."
Youk "Is this true? Quite the peculiar lunch box."
Rin "Might be."
Youk "Accept your defeat with some dignity, Mr. Fortune."

#Cut back to the group.

Char "Alright! Kyousuke, did you feel my thoughts cascading into your mind?"
Kyou "Umm, yes, I think so."
Char "Everyone, please hold your breath and applause, for I am about to place just a small slice of my galaxy-sized brain, into this normal mortal boy."
Char "Alright, Kyousuke, tell us."
Char "WHAT'S"
Char "IN"
Char "THE"
Char "BOX?"

"A silence fills the crowd."

Kyou "Um, for some reason, I feel as though I know what's in the lunchbox."
Kyou "A banana, a cup of yogurt, rice balls, and I think some sushi?"
Char "Well? Will you oblige us and open the lunchbox in question, Kanna?"

"Kanna silently opens the lunchbox, and shows it to the crowd of people."
"The contents appear to be a banana, yogurt, rice balls, and sushi, just how it was predicted."

# ART Charlotta sprite grinning.
"Charlotte breaks out into a massive grin."

Char "WAHAHAHA!"

#SFX Crowd walla (murmurs, surprised gasps and excited voice), maybe some applause.
"The crowd murmurs. Small cheers and gasps can be heard quietly from around the room."

Char "Is the audience satisfied? They sure sound like it to me. Need I  do anything more to prove just how limitless my power and influence can be?"
Char "The great and powerful Charlotte Von Vega proves herself again!"
Char "WAHAHAHA!"
Kan "Actually, Charlotte, hold that thought."

#ART Maybe a CG, if you guys want.
"Kanna pulls out the contents of the lunchbox, to reveal a blanket. In the center of the blanket, is the picture of an ordinary lunch consisting of a banana, a cup of yogurt, rice ball, and sushi."
"All around the center however, were small red and gold hearts, layered above the green fabric."
"It appears the blanket was folded in a way, so the picture of the lunch would be on top."
"If one were to peek into the lunchbox, they could probably tell it was a blanket."
"But if one were a small shadow, quickly peeking in and then looking away, they could easily mistake the picture on the blanket for real lunch items."

Kan "I made this for you, Kyousuke. I didn't have anything else to put it in, so I skipped lunch today to bring it to you!"
Maya "What? A present for Kyousuke?  Kanna, that's not fair!"
Char "Wa?"
Char "Waha?"
Char "Waha… ha?"
Kan "It's amazing you guessed the picture on the blanket, Charlotte! I wonder how you did that?"
Kan "But it looks like you're wrong this time."

Char "I…"
Char "But..."
Char "..."

#SFX light laughter
"Snickers and suppressed laughter can be heard from the kids watching."
"Charlotte holds her head up, and without saying a word, walks away from the staring group."

Youk "You... you!"
Rin "Me, that's right."
Youk "In front of everyone, how dare you!?"
Rin " She's the one to blame. We were just planning on making her look dumb in front of Kyousuke and, maybe, Maya."
Rin " But little Miss Showoff wanted everyone to watch her perform your stupid, cheating trick."
Rin "This is how us, little guys, beat the big corporate boys."
Youk "...Very well Mr. Fortune, I’ll cut you a deal"
Youk "I won't override Kyousuke's mind, so long as you don't crush Charlotte's spirit like that ever again."
Rin "I'm telling you. She did it to herself. But, alright, deal."
Rin "A healthy dose of social embarrassment never hurt anyone."
Youk "Just remember we're here to bring these kids together, not apart."
Rin "Ha! What’s a corporate slave like you know about bringing people together?"
Rin "Remember, we do have a conflict of interest. And if you're gonna cheat, I'll do what I can to prevent that."
Youk "True. Nevertheless, proper etiquette shouldn't be disregarded. See you later, Mr. Fortune"
Rin "Unfortunately, yes, you will."

#Cut back to the group.

Maya "She didn't put up much of a fight, huh? I thought she'd have like, laughed and stuff, gave a massive soliloquy on how cool she is, and denied her loss."
Kyou "Thanks for the blanket, Kanna! That's so nice of you!"
Kan "Y-yeah, of course. I wasn't sure about your favorite color. I hope you like it."
Maya "Alright, how did you know all this? How'd she know the picture on the blanket? What's the deal?"
Kan "A good magician never reveals her secrets."

#Day 6     Kanna's room.
scene room night
Kan "Ringo, what if we're doing the wrong thing?"
Kan "Are we manipulating Kyousuke like the other two girls are?"
Rin "Yea, I guess we are. But this is what you wanted, ain't it?"
Rin "Besides, there doesn't seem to be a lot of harm in it, is there?"
Kan "Tomorrow, maybe just let me talk to Kyousuke."
Kan "Even if the other two show up and get feisty.  I just want to talk to him, without you affecting him."
Rin "Kid, we made a deal. You made a wish, and I need to grant it. I really, really need to move on to retirement."
Kan "Please, Ringo, just tomorrow! We'll go back to normal after that."
Rin "{i}Sigh. {/i}"
Rin "Alright, kid, if it'll make you feel better."
Kan "You think Charlotte's alright?"
Rin "She was cheating, remember? I'm surprised our plan worked out so well. "
Kan "Same. See you tomorrow, Ringo."
