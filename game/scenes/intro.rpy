    "A young high school girl stands by the shrine. She appears to be praying, and placing some sort of charm at the shrine. Hanging it along the top rail where hundreds of other charms swing lazily in the wind."

    Kan "Uh... Hello? God? Is this thing on? Hello?"
    Kan "Um...{i}Deep breath{/i}{w=0.5}...ok. Hey God, it’s me, Kanna. I know we don’t talk often... or at all, and I know I haven’t really offered you anything before, or visited you, or even thought about you."
    Kan "Honestly I’m not even sure which one you are."
    # CODE
    # Change size tag below to a more adequate value when font and font size are decided.
    # Kanna should be muterring, so the text shown should be smaller than usual.
    Kan "{size=-10}Are all gods animals, or is that just a myth?{/size}"
    Kan "Well, this shrine happens to be the closest to my house, so I guess you get my wish!"

    #SFX Cicadas, environmental
    "Kanna waits for some sort of response, only to be met with the faint buzzing of cicadas mixed in with the soft blowing of the wind. Kanna looks up at the dangling charms, light from the full moon reflecting off them."

    Kan "Right, so if you could please grant my wish, God, I’d worship you forever! I’ll visit everyday, and pray, and offer food!"
    Kan "You name it, I’ll do it! So please grant this wish. You’re my only hope."
    Kan "Will you do it for me, God?"
    Kan "I’ll, uh...take that as a maybe."

    #SFX Footsteps "Kanna turns away from the shrine and begins to go home."

    Kan "Oh, and if you’re the god of bad relationships,  you can just pretend this never happened!"
    Kan "Well anyway, goodnight."

    #ART
    #Ringo appears faintly from the top of the shrine, not enough to fully make out that he's a little #bear, but enough to make out that he's small, and clearly a spirit of some sort

    Rin "She’s not exactly the ideal client, but she’ll do."
    Rin "Teenagers have no knack for wishmaking."
    Rin "Doesn’t really matter though, since she’s the last one."
    Rin "One more assignment and I can finally get out of this dump."
    Rin "No more sleeping on wooden floors, getting splinters in my back."
    Rin "No more tourists, no more noise, and no more of this dead-end wish granting gig."
    Rin "Just me, a nice fluffy cloud, and all the peace and quiet a spirit could want!"
    Rin "Not to mention, I’ll finally get out of this inconvenient form."
    Rin "Alright, I’m feeling motivated! Let’s get started!"

    "Ringo snags the charm and teleports to Kanna’s bedroom."

    #ART BG Kanna's Bedroom
    scene room

    #ART #SFX Ringo Entrance
    #The lights are out, welcoming in the dark of night. Kanna is cocooned in various blankets, sleeping peacefully. Her window is open, and the blue glow of the moon gently illuminates her room.
    #A large circular portal forms in the center of the room. Golden sparks, and flashes light up the room. A large explosion erupts from the circle, filling the room with smoke.
    #Ringo is summoned from the explosion, and floats in the smoke, wearing a smug expression.
    #Upon hearing the explosion, Kanna falls off of her bed, and sits awestruck on the ground with blankets all around her. She begins to run out of the room, too shocked to scream. She reaches the door, and hears a strange voice from behind her.

    Rin "Behold, human! It is I, the God of Fortune! Ringo!"

    #ART CG Kanna turns around. She stares, overwhelmed by the smoke and effects. She braces #herself in anticipation for whoever or whatever the voice was that spoke through the smoke.
    #The smoke dissipates, revealing a small, floating, bear-like spirit.

    Rin "Well, more like a representative of the god of Fortune. But I’m as close to the real thing as you’re gonna get."
    Kan "A floating teddy bear?"
    Kan "...Ha. Ahaha."
    Kan  "This is a dream, right? I usually wake up after I fall out of bed. Let me get back in and try again."

    Rin "Bzzzt! Wrong. You’re wide awake, I’m a real agent of god, and you’re about to get your wish granted."
    Kan "My wish? You mean... {i}that{/i} wish?"
    Rin  "Ding ding ding! We have a winner. You placed a wish on my shrine, and now I'm here to deliver!"
    Kan "Wait, I'm confused. What are you? Why did you pick my wish? What happe...Why are you a bear?"
    Rin "Enough questions kid. Do you want your wish granted or not?"
    Kan "I, uh - yes!"
    Rin "That's what I thought! Alright, now let's see what you asked for."

    # CODE Set the appropriate time in the wait tag to match the VAs performance.
    Rin "I, Kanna, wish for my classmate, Kyousuke, to notice me {i}deep sigh{/i}{w=0.5} and go out with me."
    Rin "Seriously? You want your life to be a bad rom com?"
    Kan "Why not? What’s wrong with that?"
    Rin "Why'd you put a love wish on a fortune shrine? There are different types of gods for a reason, you know."
    Kan "I thought I could go to any shrine and make a wish. What’s the problem? You’re a god!"
    Rin "Listen, kid, do you know how hard it is to make people fall in love?"
    Rin "It's not exactly a snap of the fingers. Love, actual love, doesn't just happen."
    Rin "It would take a miracle worker!"
    Kan "Aren’t you a miracle worker, though?"
    Rin "Course I am. But I’m also about to retire, and I want an easy gig before I go."
    Kan "Retire? From being a spirit?"
    Rin "And your wish would’ve been my last job, but this is more trouble than it's worth."
    Rin "Try the love goddess in the next town over. "
    Kan "Hold on! You can’t just barge in here, smoke out my room and get my hopes up!"
    Rin "Look kid, I get this is all very confusing, but I’m in a rush. I need to find my next client."
    Kan "Wait! You said you'd grant my wish. You and your fireworks display. Now you wanna back out?"
    #VOICE dejected
    Kan "Stupid dream ghost can't even grant my wish."
    Rin "Hey, I never said I couldn't do it."
    #Kanna Wink
    Kan "No I get it. I guess it's just too hard on you then, being so old and close to retirement."
    Rin "I didn't say that either! Do you even know what I can do? I could make you rich in a day. I could make you a popstar before lunch."
    Rin "I've even raised the dead before! That one was gross and I couldn't sleep for weeks, but hey, I did it."
    Rin "The great and powerful Ringo can do literally any dumb thing you humans wanted. So don’t go questioning me, brat."
    Kan "Prove it."
    Rin "Prove it? I don't have to prove anything to you."
    Rin "Now, good night, have a nice life or whatever."

    "Ringo floats toward Kanna's open window as she lies back in bed, facing the wall. Ringo stops in the window to look at her."

    Kan "..."
    Kan "Stupid bear."
    Rin  "..."
    Rin "{i}sigh{/i} Tell me about this guy you like."

    #Animation have Kanna's sprite suddenly become very happy.

    Kan "Really?"
    Rin "I just wanna know why you like him, that’s all."

    #MUSIC Something fun here for when Kanna starts up about Kyousuke.
    Kan "Ohh, he’s just the best! He’s got long, flowing, chocolate colored hair. It drapes over his stunning, electric eyes."
    Kan "Well, I’ve never seen his eyes... but I KNOW they’re stunning!"
    Kan "He’s the strong and silent type, so he doesn't say much. When he does talk, his voice sounds like liquefied diamonds, pouring right into my ears."
    Kan "He’s got this... presence about him. Whenever he’s in the room, it's like the world revolves around him."
    Rin "I’m sure it does."
    Kan "Oh, I know no one's perfect, and everyone has flaws. But Kyousuke is the most perfect person I’ve ever met!"
    Rin "I’m sure he is."
    Kan "It’s just, whenever I get close to him, I freeze! My heart sinks and my legs turn to jelly!"
    Kan "How's a Jane Doe like me supposed to approach a Greek Adonis like him?"
    Rin "Alright, alright, kid. Just dial it back a notch."
    Kan "Oh, please please please, I'll do anything Mr. Bear, just grant my wish!"
    Rin "It's Ringo. And even if I were to help you, it won't be easy. And you have to do everything I say."
    Kan "Really? You’ll do it?"
    Rin "That depends; repeat what I just said."
    Kan "I have to do everything you say?"
    Rin "Absolutely everything. Oh, and I get unlimited food and beverage options. You promised me food back at the shrine."
    Kan "I promise, Rango! As long as I end up with sweet, sweet Kyousuke!"
    Rin "Ringo, and I told you to dial it down. We’ll get started in the morning, so for now go back to sleep."

    Kan "Man, what a nice dream! Maybe I placed the charm on the dream god’s shrine."
    Rin "You’ll see when you wake up, kid. Get some sleep."

    #ART The camera pans outside of Kanna’s room, showing the night sky.
    "I guess finishing my career with a love wish ain’t so bad."
    "We'll aim for a week. I mean, you're just two teenagers oozing hormones, how hard could it be? I'm a spirit of fortune, I can play cupid!"
    # Pause for a bit. Consider cutting any BGM or Ambience playing.
    Rin "...Right?"
